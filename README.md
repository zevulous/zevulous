Howdy y'all, I'm Zev Burton, but you might know me as @zevulous around the internet.

I'm driven by a passion for solving national security challenges with data. My expertise lies in simplifying complex problems, developing innovative solutions, and clearly communicating results to diverse audiences. In my current role, my analytical abilities have directly contributed to securing contracts and expansions valued at over $1 million within the Intelligence, Department of Defense, and Federal Civilian sectors.

Outside of my professional career, I'm deeply interested in data science, especially in visualization and the explainability of machine learning models. I'm a firm believer in the Grandmother Test: Any results should be simple enough to explain to your grandmother, no matter how complex the process behind them.
